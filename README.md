Project for "Database 2" course. We need XAMPP (localhost).
<br />How to use:
1) Project is set on localhost, first we need to create db called "nokturn" on localhost/phpmyadmin.
2) Then we need to import nokturn.sql to newly created "nokturn" db.
3) After that we can copy and paste full Nokturn folder to the htdocs folder in xampp.
